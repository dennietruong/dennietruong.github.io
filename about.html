  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
   As a recent graduate student from Colby College (2024), I am passionate about 
    learning new things through immersive experiences, building connections, and 
    trying new/complex tasks. With an extensive background in research, I offer 
    expertise in data analytics, programming in Python, R, and SQL, statistical 
    analysis, and experience in academic publication. My enthusiasm for sports 
    inspired me to merge my strengths through my roles as an educator and researcher 
    in my position as baseball coach, with the long-term goal of becoming a data analyst 
    for a professional sports team.

  Dennie currently serves as a substitute teacher for the Garvey School District and a 
  baseball/volleyball coach for Woodcraft Rangers in partnership with the Los Angeles 
  Dodgers Foundation. In addition, he currently interns at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean 
  Sciences under senior scientist, Maya Groner, for the marine disease ecology lab.

  <p>Previously, he was a NASA Student Airborne Research Program (SARP) intern becoming 
    the inaugural class of SARP East 2023, one of 22 students selected from universities 
    across the United States. During his time at NASA, Dennie flew on NASA research B200 
    planes measuring aerosols, greenhouse gases, and soil moisture. He collaborated with 
    Susanne Craig, senior scientist in the ocean ecology lab at NASA Goddard, and Gina Ralph, 
    assistant scientist at VIMS, establishing GAM and PCA models using environmental drivers 
    to predict algal growth along the James River.
