    <h3>Potential environmental drivers of algal blooms & Utility of LANDSAT characterization of the James River (2023)
</h3>
    <p>Algal bloom is a rapid increase or accumulation of algae in a body of water using caused by excess nutrients
      usually from agricultural runoff or sewage effluent. Consequently, the effects of blooms are devastating and 
      can lead to fish kills, adverse health effects on the community and wildlife mortality. This project explores 
      the environmental factors that are driving algal bloom and determines the efficacy of LANDSAT 8 
      data in characterizing such blooms along the James River. I developed models to analyze algal blooms and used LANDSAT 
      imagery to improve environmental monitoring efforts.</p>

    <h3>Marine and synthetic glutamatergic neurotoxins accumulate in and immobilize intertidal sea stars (2022-2025)</h3>
    <p>Beginning in 2013, a massive die-off known as sea star wasting impacted billions of sea stars across more than 20 species 
      along the west coast of North America. We suspected that domoic acid, a toxin produced by algae, could weaken sea stars’ bodies 
      and contribute to their decline. In this study, we measured toxin levels in sea star tissues and conducted experiments 
      injecting the neurotoxin to observe its effects on their physiology.</p>
